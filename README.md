# Personal ENS Off-Chain Resolver
*Note the assumption here is that the owner of the ENS is running this back-end. However the back-end will no longer be required if ENS and Wallet clients like MetaMask support [EIP-5564](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5564).*

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.15. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
